  <h2 class="left">Other Details</h2>
  <ul class="left">
    <li><strong>"Closed" Retreat</strong> - One of the priorities for this retreat is to provide an
    opportunity for the youth to connect with each other and for Andrew and Jee Hye to become
    acquainted with the students. <br/>Therefore, this retreat will be limited to only the youth students of Onnuri,
    and we ask that the youth would not invite their friends for this retreat. Sorry!</li><br/>
    <li><strong>Unplugged</strong> - Retreat is a time to connect with God and with
      each other. Therefore, we ask students to leave behind any tablets, mp3 players, or other electronics that have the potential to be distractions.<br/>
      Phones will be collected at the beginning of the retreat and returned at the end of retreat. Students who rely on their phone as an alarm clock or bible app need to bring an alternative alarm clock and a printed bible.</li><br/>
    <li><strong>More details to come!</strong> (Packing list, departure and pick up times, etc.)</li>
